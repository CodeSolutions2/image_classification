# test_4_webapps

Purpose: The purpose of this Tensorflow.js Webapp is to demonstrate usage of the Tensorflow.js MobileNet API in Javascript/HTML, and to demonstrate prediction of a custom model that predicts similar types of obejcts (ie: apples from tomatoes). In this example, the MobileNet API can not predict apples from tomatoes well, without finetuning. Finetuning of the MobileNet model is demonstrated at https://www.kaggle.com/code/jamilahfoucher/tensorflowjs-image-classification-model-deploy. Additionally, training a MPCNN model with edge detection pre-processing showed similar accuracy as the finetunned MobileNet model, at accuracy of 0.9. The MPCNN model with edge detection pre-processing is available at Kaggle Models (https://www.kaggle.com/models/jamilahfoucher/image_classification_via_edge_detection).

The Tensorflow.js Webapp is located at : https://CodeSolutions2.github.io/test_4_webapps/index.html .


## Extra

If you are interested in making your own GitHub Web Page, the steps to transform a GitHub Repository are below:

0. Configure GitHub Pages: Go to your repository on GitHub. Click on the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Under the "Source" dropdown, select "master branch" or the branch you want to use for deployment. Click on the "Save" button.

1. Access your deployed website: After the configuration step, you will see a message indicating the URL where your website is deployed. It usually follows the pattern `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>`.
  
It may take a few minutes for your changes to be reflected on the deployed website. Good luck and thanks for the interest!
