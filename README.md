How to transforms a GitHub Repository into a GitHub Web Page
Configure GitHub Pages: Go to your repository on GitHub. Click on the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section. Under the "Source" dropdown, select "master branch" or the branch you want to use for deployment. Click on the "Save" button.

Access your deployed website: After the configuration step, you will see a message indicating the URL where your website is deployed. It usually follows the pattern `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/<repository-name>`. It may take a few minutes for your changes to be reflected on the deployed website.
